# CapVid: AI-Powered Video Captioning

## Overview

CapVid is a web application that automatically generates captions for videos using OpenAI's Whisper model. Users upload a video, the backend extracts audio, transcribes it with Whisper, and burns the resulting subtitles directly into the video using FFmpeg.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Transcription:** Leverages OpenAI Whisper to convert speech to text with high accuracy across multiple languages.
- **Subtitle Burning:** Uses FFmpeg to permanently embed .srt subtitles into the video file so captions are always visible.
- **React Frontend:** Clean, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS for uploading videos and previewing results.
- **Flask Backend:** Python Flask server handles file uploads, runs Whisper inference, and manages FFmpeg processing.
- **Multiple Format Support:** Accepts common video formats and outputs captioned MP4 files.

## Why I Built This

Adding subtitles to videos is tedious, you either pay for a service or manually time every line. I wanted a free, self-hosted tool that handles the entire pipeline: extract audio, transcribe, generate timed subtitles and burn them into the video, all in one click.

## Future Plans

- Support for subtitle style customization (font, color, position)
- Batch processing for multiple videos
- Real-time transcription preview before burning
- Support for multiple languages
