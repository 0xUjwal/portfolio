# Rock Paper Scissors AI

## Overview

Rock Paper Scissors AI is an intelligent game that uses an LSTM neural network to learn player behavior and predict future moves. Instead of detecting gestures, the system analyzes sequential move patterns and continuously adapts its strategy to counter the player in real time through an interactive Gradio interface.

## Key Features

* **LSTM Based Prediction:** Uses a Long Short Term Memory neural network to learn sequential move patterns.
* **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously retrains after each round to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Pattern Analysis:** Analyzes previous moves to forecast the next likely choice.
* **Model Persistence:** Saves and reloads trained models to retain learned behavior across sessions.
* **Interactive Gradio UI:** Responsive web interface with real time statistics and gameplay feedback.
* **Comprehensive Stats Tracking:** Tracks wins, losses, ties and win rate dynamically.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to explore sequence modeling and practical applications of LSTM networks in a simple but strategic environment. Rock Paper Scissors provided a clean way to experiment with behavioral prediction, adaptive learning and real time AI decision making.

## Future Plans

* Improve prediction accuracy using deeper architectures
* Add variable sequence length learning instead of fixed last 3 moves
* Introduce difficulty levels with different AI strategies
* Deploy optimized lightweight version for mobile devices
* Add analytics dashboard for player behavior insights
