# Portfolio

## Overview

My personal developer portfolio built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my projects, work experience, skills, and provides a way to get in touch. The site is statically generated for fast load times and uses MDX for rich project detail pages.

## Key Features

- **Project Showcase:** Detailed project cards with technology icons, GitHub links, and expandable MDX detail pages.
- **Work Experience:** Collapsible experience cards with role descriptions, technologies, and company links.
- **Skills Section:** Visual display of technical skills with technology icons.
- **Dark/Light Theme:** Full theme support with system preference detection and manual toggle.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout that works across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Contact Form:** Integrated contact form for reaching out directly.

## Why I Built This

Every developer needs a portfolio. I wanted mine to be fast, clean, and easy to maintain. Using Next.js with MDX means I can add new projects by simply dropping in a markdown file, and the static generation ensures the site loads instantly.

## Future Plans

- Blog section for technical writing
- Animation enhancements with Framer Motion
- Analytics dashboard integration
- Internationalization support
