# QR Code Generator

## Overview

QR Code Generator is a modern browser based application that generates high resolution QR codes instantly from any text or URL input. Built using vanilla JavaScript with a glassmorphism UI design, the entire process runs client side ensuring speed, privacy and zero server dependency.

## Key Features

* **Instant Real Time Generation:** Automatically generates QR codes as the user types.
* **High Resolution Output:** Produces 720x720px QR codes for sharp and reliable scanning.
* **Download as PNG:** Save generated QR codes with timestamped filenames.
* **Full Screen Preview Mode:** View QR codes in a dedicated full screen interface.
* **Modern Glassmorphism UI:** Elegant responsive design with custom typography.
* **Privacy Focused:** All processing happens locally in the browser with no server communication.
* **Lightweight Implementation:** Built with vanilla JavaScript and QRCode.js without heavy frameworks.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a clean, fast and privacy focused QR code generator without ads or unnecessary backend services. This project allowed me to focus on frontend polish, responsive design and client side functionality while keeping the implementation lightweight and efficient.

## Future Plans

* Custom color and style personalization for QR codes
* Logo embedding inside generated QR codes
* Bulk QR generation from CSV input
* Progressive Web App support for offline usage
* Export options in multiple formats
